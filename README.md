## Python Analysis

## Background

The Python challenges includes two challenging analysis which are PyBank and PyPoll.
Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. 

## PyBank

* In this challenge, the main task is creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company based on a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* The main task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll

* In this challenge, the fundamental task is helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process based on the set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. 

* Based on the data provided, a Python script will be created in order to analyze the votes and calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

* In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
